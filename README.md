# Computational-Financial-Engineering-in-R
## Date 02/22/18
This Repository consist of implemetation of Finanical models in R. All the files were part of an assignment and each folder will have the
copy of the questions and solutions in R. I have tried to build the code as much reproduceable as possible and it's not the
best efficient code available, but with time I am refining these code. I urge students to use it a a reference instead of copying 
the code and use it for understadning. 
Thanks to professors and all the libraries out there who have helped in building of this project.
